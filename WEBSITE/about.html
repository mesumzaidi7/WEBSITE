    <p class="about2">
      Pakistan is known for the amount of spices they put in their dishes. The
      most popular dish is biryani, which is a rice dish that can go with many
      types of meats. It is my personal favourite because of the amazing
      flavour. When you are in Pakistan, you will see many street food, which
      tastes really amazing.A famous drink is lassi, which is a yogurt drink
      best served cold. Personally, I am not a fan of it because I do not like
      the taste of yogurt.
